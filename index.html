        <p><strong>Parental advisory: Explicit content.</strong></p>
        <p>Five short songs, in total under fifteen minutes. Hopefully you can listen to the whole thing in one sitting. Donna, Boat, and Down are all about one person. Ivy is someone else. Waste is two people.</p>
        <p>Nothing in any of these songs is real or based on any real people.</p>

        <p>Lyrics:
          You're wasting your fucken time
          With brain-dead boys and you know it
          Your castle of silk, your garden of glass
          Being mangled by one who can't see it
          You say, "God I hope there's a hero
          To lift me from life underground"
          But you spit in the eyes of who can recognize you
          And cover your ears where it sounds
          
          You're wasting your fucken time
          For a dead-ended cause and you know it
          And with nothing to say you parade on your way
          Biting on your own horn as you blow it
          You say, "God I hope I get hired
          By a man with a popular name"
          But you know if you met him you'd best case just get him to
          Laugh, all these songs sound the same 
          
          You're wasting your fucken time
          On a life that you know has no reason
          Your love is all gone, your battery's dead
          You're not cute anymore, who're you pleasing?
          You say, "God I hope there's a woman
          Who'll see past the layers of shit"
          But there was and she's gone and you're not moving on
          From your vision that you can still fix it, you shit
          </p>

          <p>Lyrics:
Where did my laughter go?
Film, straight to video?
Once just a block away
The door hit her on the walk away

I said my life has been good
You said it's made up of lies
I asked you how do I look
You said I'm closing my eyes
I said I wrote you a song
You said be funny instead
I said will you listen to my song?
You said I'd rather be dead

And I said…
Nothing surprises me
Nothing excites
Nothing impresses me
Or opens my eyes
Nothing entrenches me
Nothing offends
Nothing confuses me
But nothing makes sense
Without you

How to be carried on?
Nothing left to be drawn
With the simple and uncurious
I stand here furious

I said I have an idea
You said you're wasting your time
I said I have an overwhelming joy
You said you're wasting your time
I said I wrote you a song
You said be funny instead
I said will you listen to my song?
You said I'd rather be dead

And I said…
Nothing surprises me
Nothing excites
Nothing impresses me
Or opens my eyes
Nothing entrenches me
Nothing offends
Nothing confuses me
But nothing makes sense
Without you

              <p>Lyrics:
                My parents are threatening to kill me again
                And you know that school's been hell
                Well there's a lake a few states north
                Where, Donna, I know you'd swim so well
                I'll pack up the car with some groceries
                And a couple bottles to soothe my throat
                And I'll stare over at you sitting shotgun
                But shit I'll try to remember the road
                
                And we can dance to whatever
                Stop wherever
                Whatever's your worry is mine
                But if I fall asleep at the wheel
                Donna, will you carry me over the line?
                
                The cabin's all dusty and broken
                But it's the first place we have of our own
                The beach for now is our playground
                And the bedroom's our throne
                I'm having trouble seeing you
                As the night turns blurry to black
                And I can barely move when you ask me
                When I'm coming back
                
                But I'm here for right now
                Forever right now
                You know your light I'll always find
                But if I fall asleep at the wheel
                Donna, will you carry me over the line?
                
                And I promised to hold you forever
                But we're home in a couple of days
                Did you say that you don't want to see me?
                I seemed to miss it in some kind of haze
                I could have sworn you said you loved me
                By the lake where the sun fell behind
                But the memory feels like a hailstorm
                And I think I'm losing my mind
                
                Well could you tell me what you said?
                Tell me what you said
                Please, before I lose my mind
                And if I fall asleep at the wheel
                Donna, will you carry me over the line?

                <p>Lyrics:
In another life, we're
Drinking beer on your parents boat, and we're
Forty, or thirty
And we rock back and forth with the waves
And you say I look gross with my skin so burnt
And we rock back and forth with the waves

In another life, we're
On opposite sides of the world, and we're
Married, apart
And one day we go out and meet up again
Haven't seen you in years
And I ask, Do you think about me?
You say, No
Then you ask, Do I think about you?
And I say, No

Then you go home and dream about me
'Cause I'm up all night thinking about you

In another life, we're
In Portugal, or something
I'm wearing a hat 'cause I'm balding
And we ask some guy to take our picture
He doesn't speak any English, but he does it
And the photographer says,
"Son, your quiet masculinity
Next to you, dear, with your beauty
Would be a sight for sore eyes
And long-time lovers all the same"

Then you go home and dream about me
'Cause I'm up all night thinking about you                
                  </p>

                    You know I have regrets I can hardly stand
                    And you've got one too, right now he's holding your hand
                    You keep on yelling at me My life's a mess! well I'll turn it around
                    And I'll always love you, and you'll always be down
                    
                    When I ran you followed me and you moved next door
                    And you'd had enough, but I wanted more
                    Well if I'm such a loser why'd you move into my town?
                    And I'll always love you, and you'll always be down
                    
                    I want to give you the key to my heart of hearts
                    But you ripped it out and you sold it for parts
                    And you said "What is this worthless shit? Your heart doesn't work!" and then you threw it on the ground
                    And I'll always love you, and you'll always be down
                    
                    Seen shrinks, seen doctors, but there's nothing I can do
                    There's just no healing the way I feel for you
                    I could say, "Please stay! Please stay!" but now I'm north and you're south
                    And I'll always love you, and you'll always be down
